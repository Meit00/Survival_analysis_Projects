# Survival Analysis #
## Colon Cancer ##
The colon dataset includes information on colon cancer patients, such as survival time, status (event occurred or censored), and covariates like age, sex, and treatment.
### What is the survival rate of patients with stage B/C colon cancer undergoing different chemotherapy treatments, and how do these treatments compare in terms of effectiveness? ###
1.Plot the survival curves for patients undergoing different treatments (e.g., observation, Levamisole, Levamisole + 5-FU) to visualize the survival probabilities over time
2.Assess the impact of different treatments on survival time while controlling for other covariates such as age, sex, and tumor.
3.Use the log-rank test to compare the survival distributions of the different treatment groups and determine if there are statistically significant differences in survival rates between them.
